Welcome to the Active EEG Electrode Open-Source Project! 🧠⚡  

Our project aims to democratize the field of electroencephalography (EEG) by developing and sharing open-source designs for active EEG electrodes. EEG is a powerful technique for monitoring brain activity, but the cost and complexity of traditional EEG equipment have limited its accessibility. We're here to change that!
